# Workshop Materials

This repository contains workshop materials, tutorial links and resources to get started with deep learning neural networks for medical imaging and other healthcare applications. While no formal background in machine learning is required, baseline knowledge of the Python programming language is highly recommended to maximize engagement. If you have no prior programming background, a list of online resources is available at this [link](../resources/README.md). 

All hands-on coding portions of the workshop are performed using Google Colaboratory, a free instance of the Jupyter Notebook (iPython) IDE hosted by Google Cloud. A Gmail account will be required to login and use this otherwise free service. As needed GPU-backed instances may be used on demand. No local software installation or specialized hardware is needed; all coding is performed directly in a web browser. If you are interested in setting up a persistent local or cloud development environment, including configuration of NVIDIA drivers, CUDA/cudNN, Tensorflow and Jupyter, see links at the bottom of this page.
