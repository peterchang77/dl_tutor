    "\n",
    "At this point of the model, to convert from CNN to MLP architecture, the `(1, N, N, C)` feature maps need to be collapsed into vector form. A `layers.Flatten()` operation may accomplish this by converting our feature map to a single `(1 * N * N * C,)` vector. An alternative to this is to use a `layers.Reshape()` operation to convert our feature map to a `(1, 1, 1, N * N * C)` feature map; subsequently, any additional 3D convolutional operation with kernel size `(1, 1, 1, C-in, C-out)` will be **identical** to a matrix multiply operation.\n",

    "```\n",

    "In this implementation (and all other tutorial examples) we will use the second option using `layers.Reshape(...)`. The rationale is that while we are currently training with 2D input slices of shape `(1, 240, 240)`, once the model is trained we would like to pass any volume of arbitrary size into the model (e.g., many slices). A global `layers.Flatten()` operation will convert the entire 3D volume into a vector without preserving slice-by-slice information. A `layers.Reshape([-1, 1, 1, N * N * C])` operation however will be able to flexibly handle arbirary shapes.\n",
